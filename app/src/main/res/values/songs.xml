If there really is a God, then it's punishing me constantly
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted more
But no, I'm reduced to a Rottypanol snort and a lot of drinks
This shit goes on and on, just look down my pants
Rejection!
It ain't a fucking game
Rejection!
My human dick to blame
Rejection!
A sociopathic plan
Rejection!
Is feeding what I am
Rejection!
Takes life away from eyes
Rejection!
Will give you to the skies
Rejection!
It makes me more than a man
Rejection!
Is drowning what I am"

Through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon
In silver trees
Falls down in tears\n
Light of the night
The Earth
A purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
While down
Below the trees
Bathed in a cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night
And so
We pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel
